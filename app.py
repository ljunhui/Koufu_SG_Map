                                #### Objectives:
                                
                                - A data driven approach visualizing the population density of all 332 sub-zones found in Singapore and grouping them into 5 discrete brackets. Subzone information such as total area (in km2) and total population is provided in a tooltip.
                                - A table of summary is also provided at the bottom of the page that aggregates information about each subzone into their main planning areas.
                                - The dashboard is meant to be used as a supplementary tool, allowing BD managers to make quick decisions about zone demographics, paving the way for further exploration regarding the business viability of opening outlets in those zones.
                                
                                ###### Future Work:
                                - Benchmark outlet sales performance against expected sales owing to population density.
                                - Identify best brands to bring into the subzone based on subzone age-group distribution.
                                
                                ###### Limitations:
                                - Commercial/industrial areas were not well covered due to the lack of workforce information but that is beyond the scope of this project.

                                #### Usage Instructions:
                                - By default, the map is set to show our foodcourt and coffeeshop brands (Koufu, Gourmet Paradise, Happy Hawkers etc). 
                                - **Using the layer control in the top right corner of the map gives you control of which brands to show.**
                                - The choropleth layer provides more information about the zone, with the colors indicating the population density of each zone. 
                                The darkest colors are zones that have the highest population density. 
                                - **Mouse over subzones (tap if on mobile) displays more information about each subzone.**
